# Introduction #

This is a small web application which tries to help RIC team members to have a high level and also a detailed content of a release at his finger tips in just a couple of clicks.

During the execution of a release, I feel that it's very important for the person who is executing the release to have a global view of the content of the release without having to consult manually different DB tables or Synergy queries for the content of the release. It is also important that he should have the details of content in an excel sheet so that he could review the contents before starting the release. 

A given release has the following content:

* List of patches
* DB members
* Transfer operations
* Synergy Objects
* DB members that are impacted by the member types
