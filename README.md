This is a small web application which tries to help a B&D user with the generation of the different Excel files used during the execution of a transfer. 
During the execution of the transfer it's considered best practice to have an excel file with the list of patches being transferred, 
DB members and the transfer operations that are part of the execution of the transfer.
